\chapter{Needs}
This chapter contains the operational needs necessary to solve the problems described in chapter \ref{chap:problems}. 

The problems in chapter \ref{chap:problems} have existed for as long as humans have tried to coordinate larger groups of actors on different missions. The problems have therefore always been solved to a certain extent, but the rapid improving technology constantly enables better solutions to be implemented. With the technology now available it is possible to develop a high-tech system with a digital Common Operational Picture (COP) with a variety of relevant real time information. The right information along with real time tracking of the users of the system will enable commanders to constantly be aware of the status of the mission and thereby to carry out missions more efficiently. 

This sums up the following needs the system seeks to fulfill:

\begin{description}
\item[N-010] The users need to be able to pass information to one another. 
\item[N-020] The user needs relevant real time static and dynamic information. 
\item[N-030] The user needs geographical position tracking of the other users of the system.
\item[N-040] The system needs a warranty period for 10 years. 
\end{description}
