The effectiveness of an emergency management team deployed on the location of a crisis situation, is greatly dependent on the team's situational awareness. The more emergency response actors involved in a crisis situation, the greater the need for an overview of the crisis through situational awareness. Without a Common Operational Picture (COP) in a crisis situation, the efficiency of the different emergency response actors cannot be maximized as there will be a lack of communication and relevant exchange of information between the actors.
