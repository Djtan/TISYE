The effectiveness of an emergency management team deployed on the location of a crisis situation is greatly dependent on the team's situational awareness. The more emergency response actors involved in a crisis situation, the higher is the risk of losing overview and control of the situation. The lack of overview might end up in important information getting lost and missions being carried out in undesirable ways.
