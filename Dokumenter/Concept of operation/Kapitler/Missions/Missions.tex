\section{Missions}
The system is intended to increase the situational awareness of emergency response units, when operational during a crisis situation. The system includes a COP which will provide situational awareness to the commanders in charge of the operation. From a mobile HQ the commanders can evaluate incoming information, act upon it and possibly dispatch orders or information to relevant actors to respond to - all through the COP.

Additionally, a hand-held Dismounted COP must provide a condensed COP which enables the commanders to act independently of the mobile HQ.
