\section{Support and Warranty}

In contrast to many software acquisitions, which are typically delivered "as is" and without warranty of any kind, the customer of SitaWare Civilian specifically requests that software shall be covered by warranty. Warranty period shall be at least 10 years. The customer requires the paragraphs in figure \ref{fig:warranty} to be part of the warranty.
