\chapter{Time Plan}
This chapter presents the time plan for the entire project planning and development. 

The upper part of the time plan at figure \ref{fig:timeplan} shows the project phases and their associated tasks described in chapter \ref{chap:phases} and \ref{chap:wbs} respectively. Please note the dates in the left side as the last two phases extends for a much longer time than the graphics show. 

The lower part of figure \ref{fig:timeplan} shows the milestones and when their corresponding reviews are to be carried out.
