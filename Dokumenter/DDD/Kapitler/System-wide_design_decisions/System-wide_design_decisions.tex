\chapter{System-wide Design Decisions}

In this chapter, the decision for the system-wide detailed design is made.
\section{Hardware decisions}
\textbf{The HQ} shall be a stationary post mounted in a mobile vehicle. It must be implemented on a well known hardware platform. The user interaction is supposed to be a mix between use of mouse, keyboard and touch screen. It must be possible to give all commands from here.\\

\textbf{The Dismounted COP} shall be mounted on the wrist of the user. Therefor the Dismounted COP must be within dimensions of 13x6x1 cm. It must be shock-, water- and heat resistant. The Dismounted COP must have a touch screen which can be used with or without gloves.

%\textbf{A Server} shall
