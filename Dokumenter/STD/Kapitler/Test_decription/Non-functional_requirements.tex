\begin{description}
\item[ST-1110] Turn on the system and start a timer. When the system is ready to respond to user input stop the timer. Verify that the time passed is less than 5 minutes.

\item[ST-1120]Write a test program that gets the system to enter an error state. Verify that the a red indicator is shown. 

\item[ST-1130] Turn off the system and start a timer. When the system powers off stop the timer. Verify that the time passed is less than 5 minutes.

\item[ST-1140]Move the hand-held dismounted COP more than 100 meters within 10 seconds and stop moving. Verify that the location of the device registered in the system is updated within 10 seconds after stop. 

\item[ST-1150]Post COP-information from the system to a device and start a timer. When the information is available on the device stop the timer. Verify that the time passed is less than 10 seconds. 

\item[ST-1160]Register information from a device to the system and start a timer. When the registered information is available on the other devices stop the timer. Verify that the time passed is less than 15 seconds. 

\item[ST-1170]Post weather information from the system to a device and start a timer. When the information is available on the device stop the timer. Verify that the time passed is less than 10 seconds. 

\item[ST-1180] Expose the dismounted COP to 0.20 Sievert and increase the radiation up to 0.30 Sievert in steps of 0.01 Sievert. Confirm that the dismounted COP warns the user about dangerous radiation levels via the GUI and the audio interface when the measured radiation level exceeds 0.25 Sievert. 

\item[ST-1190] Expose the dismounted COP to -30°C and decrease the temperature down to -50°C in steps of 0.1°C. Confirm that the dismounted COP warns the user about dangerous temperature levels via the GUI and the audio interface when the measured temperature is below -40°C.\\
Expose the dismounted COP to 60°C and increase the temperature up to 80°C in steps of 0.1°C. Confirm that the dismounted COP warns the user about dangerous temperature levels via the GUI and the audio interface when the measured temperature is above 70°C. 

\item[ST-1200] Expose the dismounted COP to an oxygen level of 5\%. Increase the oxygen level up to 15\% in steps of 0.1\%. Confirm that the dismounted COP warns the user about dangerous oxygen levels via the GUI and the audio interface when the measured oxygen level is above 10\%. 

\item[ST-1210] Perform a bit error rate test (BERT) of the data communication and verify that it has a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$ or less. 

\item[ST-1220] Weigh the hand-held dismounted COP. Verify that the weight does not exceed 1kg.
