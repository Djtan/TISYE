\item[ST-0510] Expose the dismounted COP to 0.20 Sievert and increase the radiation up to 0.30 Sievert in steps of 0.01 Sievert. Confirm that the dismounted COP warns the user about dangerous radiation levels via the GUI and the audio interface when the measured radiation level exceeds 0.25 Sievert. 
\item[ST-0520] Expose the dismounted COP to -30°C and decrease the temperature down to -50°C in steps of 0.1°C. Confirm that the dismounted COP warns the user about dangerous temperature levels via the GUI and the audio interface when the measured temperature is below -40°C.\\
Expose the dismounted COP to 60°C and increase the temperature up to 80°C in steps of 0.1°C. Confirm that the dismounted COP warns the user about dangerous temperature levels via the GUI and the audio interface when the measured temperature is above 70°C. 
\item[ST-0530] Expose the dismounted COP to oxygen levels below 15\% and decrease the concentration of oxygen. Confirm that the dismounted COP warns the user about dangerous oxygen levels via the GUI and the audio interface.
