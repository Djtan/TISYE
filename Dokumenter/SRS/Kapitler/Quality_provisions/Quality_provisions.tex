\chapter{Quality provisions}
The following chapter describes how each requirement is qualified. The chapter consists of two tables, one describing the different qualification methods and another describing how each of the requirements is qualified.\\



\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{9cm}|}
\hline
 \textbf{Qualification Method} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
 Demonstration & Qualification of the requirement is done by demonstration of the system. \\  \hline
 Test & Qualification of the requirement is verified by a test. \\  \hline
 Analysis & Qualification of the requirement is verified through analysis.  \\  \hline %SKAL vi fjerne den eftersom vi ikke benytter den?
 Inspection & Qualification of the requirement is done by an inspection.  \\  \hline %SKAL vi fjerne den eftersom vi ikke benytter den?
 Contract & Qualification of the requirement is verified through a contract. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\hline
 \textbf{System requirement} & \textbf{Qualification method} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
 FR-0030 & Demonstration & Upon start-up the system should have a initialization screen.   \\  \hline
 FR-0040 & Demonstration & It is visual demonstrated that the system is in the active state after the initialization screen.   \\  \hline 
 FR-0050 & Demonstration & When an error occurs the system should notify the users and switch to the error state.\\  \hline
 FR-0060 & Demonstration & Upon shut-down the system should have a shut-down screen.\\  \hline
 FR-0070 & Demonstration & After the system is started it is verified through a demonstration that the default mode is active \\  \hline
 FR-0080 & Demonstration & After the system is started, it is possible to switch to commander mode \\  \hline
 FR-0090 & Demonstration & After the system is started, it is possible to switch to administrator mode\\  \hline 
  
 FR-0110 & Test & A test is made to verify that all active devices have a location \\  \hline
 FR-0115 & Demonstration & A demonstration with all different devices is made\\  \hline
 FR-0120 & Demonstration & A demonstration is made showing the COP with human population density information\\  \hline
 FR-0130 & Demonstration & A demonstration is made showing the COP with topographic information\\  \hline
 FR-0140 & Demonstration & A demonstration is made showing the COP with traffic information\\  \hline
 FR-0150 & Demonstration & A demonstration is made showing the COP with infrastructure information \\  \hline
 FR-0160 & Demonstration & A demonstration is made showing the COP with locations of freshwater for fire fighting purposes \\  \hline
 FR-0170 & Demonstration & An observation registered by a user, and the registered observation is displayed on another device. \\  \hline
 FR-0180 & Demonstration & Through a demonstration weather information is showed on each device\\  \hline
% FR-0190 & Demonstration & Through a demonstration it is showed that the user can use a filter to remove the selected information type on the COP\\ 
% FR-0200 & Demonstration & Through a demonstration for each user type, all previous events is showed\\  \hline
% FR-0210 & Demonstration & Through a demonstration the platforms currently employed is used to register an event\\  \hline
% FR-0220 & Demonstration & Through a demonstration the platforms currently employed is used to receive information from the system\\  \hline
